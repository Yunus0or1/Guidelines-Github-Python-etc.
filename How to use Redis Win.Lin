In linux use this command to install:

    sudo apt-get install redis-server

To check if running:
 
    sudo service redis-server stop
    sudo redis-server
    
To restart:

    sudo service redis-server restart

After redis server gets started in one terminal, open another terminal and write:

    redis-cli

You will get a redis command line interface.
