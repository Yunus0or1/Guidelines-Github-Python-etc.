# Dart 

Install Dart from this link : https://www.dartlang.org/tools/sdk

To install Dart project from command line use these commands : 

    pub global activate stagehand
    mkdir fancy_project
    cd fancy_project
    stagehand package-simple



# Protocol Buffer

Go to this link first to download ProtoC :

  https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases
  
Now create a new folder named ProtoC in C:/Program Files(x86) and extract the downloaded file in ProtoC.
You will find three new files. I have downloaded ProtoC v3.7.1
Now copy the exe path. For my case this is : C:/Program Files(x86)/ProtoC/bin
Open up Start and search Environment Variable. Go to Advanced->Environment Variables..
In User variable section find PATH, double click it and click on New.
Paste the path you copied.
Start CMD and write this command :
    
    protoc --version
    
It should show libprotoc 3.7.1
You have successfully installed Protocol Buffer.


# Dart with ProtoBuf

When installing a Dart project it will not have all the packages. So some commands must be executed in order to use Protocl Buffer
in Dart. First write this command :
  
    pub global activate protoc_plugin
    
To link all the packages between Dart and Procol Buffer use this command :

    pub get [This will generate a .pacakages file which contains all local links of Dart libraries]
    
Go to pubspec.yaml and add this under 'dev_dependencies' add this dependency :

    protobuf: ^0.10.1
    grpc: ^1.0.2

Now inside the Dart project create a folder named 'protos'. Write a .proto file inside it for example it is 'data.proto' . 
And to produce ProtoBuf auto generated with gRPC files write this command for Dart :

    protoc --dart_out=grpc:. data.proto  [./lib2 means create auto generated files in same directory as data.proto resides]
