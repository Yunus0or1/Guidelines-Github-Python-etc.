# Protocol Buffer

Go to this link first to download ProtoC :

  https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases
  
Now create a new folder named ProtoC in C:/Program Files(x86) and extract the downloaded file in ProtoC.
You will find three new files. I have downloaded ProtoC v3.7.1
Now copy the exe path. For my case this is : C:/Program Files(x86)/ProtoC/bin
Open up Start and search Environment Variable. Go to Advanced->Environment Variables..
In User variable section find PATH, double click it and click on New.
Paste the path you copied.
Start CMD and write this command :
    
    protoc --version
    
It should show libprotoc 3.7.1
You have successfully installed Protocol Buffer.


# Dart with ProtoBuf

When installing a Dart project it will not have all the packages. So some commands must be executed in order to user Protocl Buffer
in Dart. First write this command :
  
    pub global activate protoc_plugin
