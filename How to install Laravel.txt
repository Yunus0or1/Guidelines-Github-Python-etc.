************************ Basic *********************
Install Xaamp. Google for it.
Install Composer. Google 'Composer Laravel' .
To start a project open CMD and run this command ' composer create-project laravel/laravel your-project-name 4.2.* '

************************ Reinstall laravel project from Github  ***************************

When upload laravel project to Github, git ignores all the dependencies and .env file. So these must be installed manually. After cloning
the project open CMD and cd to that directory. Then type these commands :



    composer install
    composer dump-autoload
    copy .env.example .env  [To copy .env file]

    php artisan key:generate
    php artisan migrate
    php artisan serve
    
    Go to localhost:8000
    
    
 To be noticed : It can not be guranteed that these commands will run without any error. 
 There is problem with different versions of Laravel.
 If you face error please knock me by mail or 
 Google this to sort out the problem.
