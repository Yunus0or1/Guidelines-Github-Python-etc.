# How to use Github.
First open a new repository using the '+' icon on the right most corner.
You can initialize your repo with a readme.md file.
If you init your repo with a readme.md file it will not show your remote git link. To find it press the 'Clone or download button'. You will find a link which redirect to your current repository.
Now to upload the source code first download the Git software for windows using this link https://git-scm.com/download/win . Install it.
Right click on the local folder and start GitBash here.
Write the following commands :
	git init
	git add . [Add all the files of that folder]
	git commit -m 'First Commit'
	git remote add origin <your remote git link>
	git push -u origin master
Now you can delete your local files.
To edit the existing repository firstly create a local folder in your computer.
Right click on the local folder and start GitBash here.
Write the following commands :
	git init
	git remote add origin <your remote git link>
	git pull origin master [This command will download all the files of your existing repository]
	[Edit file / Add file]
